# POL-Scripts
Play On Linux scripts I have written

The "icons" and "screenshot" folders are only used for archival here. They are required when submitting scripts to POL. Scripts tagged as "NOT POL Approved" do not have working icons.

* Viscera Cleanup Detail - Can be used to install VCD, the DLC "House of Horrors" and the two spin off games "Santa's Rapage" and "Shadow Warrior". [Not POL Approved]
* Titanic: Adventure Out of Time - Not currently working. Install fails to copy a few files, game fails at launch with error. WineHQ reports this as working 7 years ago.
