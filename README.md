# POL-Scripts
Play On Linux scripts I have written

The "icons" and "screenshot" folders are only used for archival here. They are required when submitting scripts to POL. Scripts tagged as "NOT POL Approved" do not have working icons.

**Working**

* Viscera Cleanup Detail - Can be used to install VCD, the DLC "House of Horrors" and the two spin off games "Santa's Rapage" and "Shadow Warrior". [Not POL Approved]

**Installing**

* Starcraft 1.18 PTR - Blizzard is releasing starcraft for free. Its currently still in beta (PTR), but this script will fetch and install it. Currently only StarEdit (map maker) works, SC bombs out when trying to download an update from blizz. [Not POL Approved]

* The Day The World Broke - Disc is not found by wine, I assume this is due to some DRM. [Not POL Approved]

* Titanic: Adventure Out of Time - Game runs, but colors are not correct. Not playable. WineHQ reports this as working 7 years ago. [Not POL Approved]

**Not Working**

**In The Works**

* Star Trek Elite Force 1 & 2
* Star Trek Armada 1 & 2
* Muppet Treasure Island
* World of Warcraft 1.12.1 Private Server
